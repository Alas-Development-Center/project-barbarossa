### Readme Structure:


1. **Introduction**

"project/barbarossa", a pioneering initiative to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on the Azerbaijani translation of the Stanford Alpaca dataset. This project represents a significant step in enhancing natural language processing capabilities for the Azerbaijani language. Utilizing the self-instruct method, our aim is to improve the understanding and generation of Azerbaijani text in AI models.

2. **Background**
   - Information about Stanford Alpaca dataset
   - The concept of instruction-tuning and self-instruct method
   - The need for Azerbaijani language support in LLMs

3. **Objectives**
   - Main goals of the project
   - Expected outcomes

4. **Methodology**
   - Detailed description of the fine-tuning process
   - Explanation of how the Stanford Alpaca dataset was translated into Azerbaijani
   - Information about the 20 LLMs used

5. **Results and Findings**
   - Summary of key findings
   - Any notable improvements or challenges encountered

6. **Usage and Guidelines**
   - Instructions on how to use the fine-tuned models
   - Any prerequisites or dependencies

7. **Contributing**
