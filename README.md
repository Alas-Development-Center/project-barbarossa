1. **Introduction**

"project/Barbarossa", a pioneering initiative to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on the Azerbaijani translation of the Stanford Alpaca dataset. This project represents a significant step in enhancing natural language processing capabilities for the Azerbaijani language. Utilizing the self-instruct method, our aim is to improve the understanding and generation of Azerbaijani text in AI models.

The project is named 'Barbarossa' inspired by the Ottoman naval commander Barbaros Hayrettin Pasha, a figure synonymous with exploration, mastery, and transformation in maritime history. Just as Barbarossa played a pivotal role in establishing Ottoman supremacy in the Mediterranean through strategic conquests and naval innovation, this project aims to navigate the uncharted waters of Azerbaijani language AI. The name 'Barbarossa' symbolizes our ambition to lead and innovate in this field, much like the historical figure who transformed the maritime dynamics of his era.
